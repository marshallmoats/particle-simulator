# particle-simulator
Basic particle simulator written in Rust. Left click to add "protons", right click for "electrons". On startup, opposite charges attract and like charges repel, but you can hit middle mouse button to make opposite charges repel and like charges attract. Hold backspace to remove the most recently added particles, or hit enter to remove all particles. Hit escape to exit.
